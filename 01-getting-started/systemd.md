# ðŸ§  What Is systemd?

systemd(parallel and dependency-aware init system) is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is the init system used by most modern Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian, Fedora) to boot the system, manage processes, and control services.


It replaces the traditional SysVinit system with a faster, more parallelized, and more feature-rich approach to managing services and the system lifecycle.


## ðŸ”§ Key Responsibilities of systemd

- Service Management: Starts, stops, restarts, and tracks services (systemctl)
- Boot Process: Initialization	Initializes the system from power-on (as PID 1)
- Logging: Collects logs using the journald system (journalctl)
- Device and Mount Management: Integrates with udev and mount systems
- Timers: (cron alternative)	Runs scheduled tasks (systemd-timer)
- Network Configuration: Manages networking via systemd-networkd
- Resource Control: Uses cgroups to limit and monitor system resources
- Socket Activation: Starts services on-demand when needed
- User Sessions	Manages: user logins and sessions securely


You can measure and analyze Linux boot performance using the systemd-analyze tool. It gives you insights into how long your system takes to boot and what parts (kernel, initrd, user space) contribute most to the delay.


```bash
systemd-analyze     #time spent in kernel, starting services, total boot time, when the multiuser-target is reached 

systemd-analyze blame      #shows which services took the longest to start (from slowest to fastest).

systemd-analyze critical-chain    #shows dependency chains and their timingâ€”useful for spotting bottlenecks in service startup sequences.
